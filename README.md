Python Parser for PaperlessFBO airplane / flight instructor reservation management system

This is probably going to be unuseable with future updates of PaperlessFBO as I do not have access to this system anymore. 
It was quite useful during my flight training to:

  - Access the flight schedule quickly
  - Create a calendar event for each flight with the airplane and instructor (in ICS format, can be used on Apple Calendar and other calendar software)
  - Determine if the airplane is available before the reserved time
